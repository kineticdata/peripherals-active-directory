[Search By]
    'Dinstinguished Name', or 'Email Address'
[Search Value]
    The value of the Distinguished Name, or Email
    Address to search for

==== Sample Configuration
Search By::                             Email Address
Search Value::                          distributionlistname@acmecompany.com

=== Results
Handler Error Message::     Error message if an error was encountered and 
                            Error Handling is set to "Error Message".
Email Addresses::           The email addresses of all users in the group.

=== Detailed Description
This handler will use the server information and user credentials configured in
the task info values to authenticate and connect to the specified Active
Directory server (using LDAP) and search for the distribution group on the
search parameters provided.  If Email Address is the 'search by' parameter, the
handler looks for a '@' symbol in the User Logon to determine how to search for
the User Logon name.  A '@' symbol indicates a search for the LDAP attribute
userPrincipalName (up to 100 characters) while the absence of the '@' symbol
will result in a search for the LDAP attribute sAMAccountName (pre-Windows 2000).

* If 'Distinguished Name' is selected, the 'distinguishedName' attribute will be
  used directly to retrieve the User objects that are a member of the provided group.
* If 'Email Address' is selected, the Distinguished Name of the group will first be
  searched for by the mail address.

=== Important Note
This handler has been tested on Task 4.0.6 and should preform as expected on
all Task 4.x.x versions.
