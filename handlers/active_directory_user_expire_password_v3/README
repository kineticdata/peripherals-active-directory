== Active Directory User Expire Password
Retrieves a user based on Distinguished Name, Full Name, User Logon, or Email
Address and marks the password as expired.  This handler will fail if the user
is not found, or if more than one result is found.

For more information, see the Detailed Description section below.

=== Parameters
[Error Handling] 
    How to handle error conditions in the handler: raise the error, or return error message
[Search By]
    'Distinguished Name', 'Full Name', 'User Logon', or 'Email Address'
[Search Value]
    The value of the Distinguished Name, Full Name, User Logon, or Email
    Address to search for

==== Sample Configuration
Search By::                             User Logon
Search Value::                          <%=@answers['ReqFor Login ID']%>

=== Results
Handler Error Message::     Error message if an error was encountered and 
                            Error Handling is set to "Error Message".

=== Detailed Description
This handler will use the server information and user credentials configured in
the task info values to authenticate and connect to the specified Active
Directory server (using LDAP) and search for the user based on the
search parameters provided.  If User Logon is the 'search by' parameter, the
handler looks for a '@' symbol in the User Logon to determine how to search for
the User Logon name.  A '@' symbol indicates a search for the LDAP attribute
userPrincipalName (up to 100 characters) while the absence of the '@' symbol
will result in a search for the LDAP attribute sAMAccountName(pre-Windows 2000).
Finally, the handler will set the password to expired.  This is analogous to
checking the box marked "User must change password at next logon" on the active
directory users and computers administration tool.

* If 'Distinguished Name' is selected, the 'distinguishedName' attribute will be
  used directly to retrieve the User entry.
* If 'Full Name' is selected, the 'cn' attribute will be used to retrieve the
  User entry.
* If 'User Name' is selected, the 'userprincipalname' value will be used if the
  "Search Value" parameter includes an '@' sign (IE john.doe@domain.com) and the
  'samaccountname' will be used if it does not (IE john.doe).
* If 'Email Address' is selected, the 'mail' attribute will be used to retrieve
  the User entry.

This handler will fail if the user is not found, or if more than one
result is found.
