[Search Value]

    Address to search for

=== Detailed Description
This handler will use the server information and user credentials configured in
the task info values to authenticate and connect to the specified Active
Directory server (using LDAP) and search for the user based on the
search parameters provided.  If User Logon is the 'search by' parameter, the
handler looks for a '@' symbol in the User Logon to determine how to search for
the User Logon name.  A '@' symbol indicates a search for the LDAP attribute
userPrincipalName (up to 100 characters) while the absence of the '@' symbol
will result in a search for the LDAP attribute sAMAccountName(pre-Windows 2000).
Finally, the flag is unset for 'password never expires' so that the password
will expire.

* If 'Distinguished Name' is selected, the 'distinguishedName' attribute will be
  used directly to retrieve the User entry.
* If 'Full Name' is selected, the 'cn' attribute will be used to retrieve the
  User entry.
* If 'User Name' is selected, the 'userprincipalname' value will be used if the
  "Search Value" parameter includes an '@' sign (IE john.doe@domain.com) and the
  'samaccountname' will be used if it does not (IE john.doe).
* If 'Email Address' is selected, the 'mail' attribute will be used to retrieve
  the User entry.

This handler will fail if the user is not found, or if more than one
result is found.
